# Classification-Tree-FromScratch
The project was done in 60-607A Algorithms for Optimization and Big Data Analysis

## Main functions
1) meilleur_split : Find the best split of a feature
2) construction_arbre : Build the tree with a binary heap structure.
3) predict: Prediction of new observations

## Hyperparameters

•	3 hyperparameters are implemented (maximum depth, impurity criterion, minimum information gain)

## Performance

•	Slower than sklearn to predict 1 million new observations
•	Better performance on the Iris dataset
